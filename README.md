# AoC2024

Advent of Code 2024 in Python. I'm not a competitive programmer nor trained. I don't really do this sort of thing for a living
so I don't expect to knock it out of the park. I also aiming for completion alone (within a reasonable window of time) and not
compactness nor lowest speed or resource utilization.

## Create Scaffolding

Creates a new directory and empty files needed for puzzle. `n` is the day number. `./create 5` would create `day5` directory.

```shell
./create.sh [n]
```

## Run Project

Runs the puzzle of the day where `n` is the day number. Wraps commands in `time` just to get a sense of execution time.

```shell
./run.sh [n]
```
